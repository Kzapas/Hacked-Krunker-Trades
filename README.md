# Hacked Krunker Trades
Ethically hack your friends with a simple chrome extension that looks and claims to be an automatic CSS styler for Krunker in a web browser. This extension, however, does more than just custom CSS styling. When a user installs the extension, they are also installing a tool that will change a proposed traded item (the item has to be Love skin for Semi-Auto) to a Redux (these items can be changed within the code). 

This is a great way to scam someone out of a massively expensive item for which in return they get a merely worthless Semi-Auto skin. 

I AS THE PUBLISHER DO NOT SUGGEST NOR ENDORSE THE ACTION OF USING THIS SCRIPT. I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OR FOLLOWING CONSEQUENCES FOR USERS OF THIS EXTENSION.

Here is the published chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-krunker-ui-red/jafhlmcnabmkogfngokplamjfcngjflj
